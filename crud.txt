This code implements a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a blog system using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it works:

1. Importing necessary modules: At the beginning of the code, it imports required modules such as `express`, `blog-router`, and `body-parser`. `express` is the web framework used to create the API, `blog-router` contains the routes related to blog CRUD operations, and `body-parser` is used to parse incoming JSON data.

2. Creating an Express app: The code creates an Express app using `express()`. It sets up the app to use `body-parser` to parse incoming JSON data.

3. Defining routes: The code sets up the routes using the `myRouter` imported from `blog-router`. The routes are defined for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog entries.

4. Starting the server: The code listens on port 3000 and starts the server. When the server starts, it establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the `mysql2` package.

5. The `blog-model` module: This module defines functions to interact with the MySQL database for performing CRUD operations on the blog table. It exports these functions to be used in the `blog-controller` module.

6. The `blog-controller` module: This module exports functions to handle HTTP requests related to blog CRUD operations. Each function in this module interacts with the `blog-model` to perform the corresponding CRUD operation on the MySQL database.

7. The `mysql.createConnection`: This is the method used to establish a connection to the MySQL database. The provided configuration includes the host, user, password, and database name.

Now, let's walk through the CRUD process:

- **Create**: The `createBlog` function in the `blog-controller` module handles the HTTP POST request for creating a new blog entry. It extracts the required data from the request body (name, information, image, date) and passes it to the `blogModel.create` function. The `blogModel.create` function inserts the new blog entry into the database.

- **Read**: The `getAllBlogs` function in the `blog-controller` module handles the HTTP GET request to retrieve all blog entries. It calls the `blogModel.getAll` function, which fetches all the blog entries from the database and returns them as a response.

- **Update**: The `updateBlog` function in the `blog-controller` module handles the HTTP PUT request to update a specific blog entry. It extracts the required data (id, name, information, image, date) from the request and passes it to the `blogModel.update` function. The `blogModel.update` function updates the corresponding blog entry in the database based on the provided id.

- **Delete**: The `deleteBlog` function in the `blog-controller` module handles the HTTP DELETE request to delete a specific blog entry. It extracts the id of the blog entry from the request parameters and passes it to the `blogModel.delete` function. The `blogModel.delete` function removes the corresponding blog entry from the database based on the provided id.

Overall, this code sets up a basic API for managing blog entries in a MySQL database. It defines routes to handle various CRUD operations and connects to the database using the `mysql2` package. The separation of concerns is achieved by using different modules for routes, controllers, and database interactions.
